* obfits_diag_nc.py:  Compute text file summarizing fit to obs stats.  Edit and set 'sondesonly' parameter
to True if you don't wait aircraft data included.

* plotobfits_rms.py:  Plot RMS stats in text file generated by obfits_diag_nc.py (plots two experiments,
a control plus an experimental run).

* plotreplayrmsinct.py: Plot zonal mean time mean replay increment for temperature.

* plotreplayrmsincq.py: Plot zonal mean time mean replay increment for specific humidity.

* plotreplayinc_profile.py:  Plot vertical profile of mean replay increment output by plotreplayincrmst.py
and plotreplayrmsincq.py for two experiments.
